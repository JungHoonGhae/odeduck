# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenDataCTL are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/). The release workflow uses the `## [X.Y.Z]`
section matching a `vX.Y.Z` tag as the GitHub release notes.

## [0.9.0]

### Added

- **OpenDataCTL is the new product and command name.** The name spells out the
  product's job: an AI control plane for Korean open data, connecting natural-
  language discovery, specification inspection, utilization application,
  approval status, credential injection, and the first live API call.
- Release archives contain both `opendatactl` and a `gongctl` compatibility
  binary. Legacy `gongctl_*` archive names also remain available for saved v0.8
  installer copies. The old `GONGCTL_VERSION` and `GONGCTL_OLLAMA_URL`
  environment variables and `gongctl://guide` MCP resource remain supported
  during the transition.

### Changed

- The Go module, GitHub repository references, release archives, installer,
  Homebrew cask, MCP implementation identity, user agent, command help, and
  current documentation now use `github.com/JungHoonGhae/opendatactl` and the
  `OpenDataCTL` brand.
- Fresh installations store state in the operating system's standard
  `opendatactl` configuration directory. Existing users continue using their
  `gongctl` directory in place, so login cookies, API keys, catalogues, and
  semantic indexes are neither copied nor lost.

### Migration

- Replace `gongctl` with `opendatactl` in shell scripts and MCP configuration.
  The old command remains functional in v0.9, but new integrations should use
  `opendatactl`.
- Go installations must use
  `go install github.com/JungHoonGhae/opendatactl/cmd/opendatactl@latest` because
  the module path follows the renamed repository.

## [0.8.0]

### Added

- **Goal-based public-data discovery** with `catalog discover` and MCP
  `catalog_search`. Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Cursor Agent can turn an
  everyday goal into distinct opportunity axes; deterministic catalogue search
  then explores all 11,902 OpenAPIs without sending the catalogue to the model.
  Optional Ollama/EmbeddingGemma vectors recover differently worded candidates
  without making a model server or vector database mandatory.
- **A progressive agent workflow that closes the access gap:**
  `catalog_search → describe_api → (apply when needed) → call_api`. The application
  tool is now presented as the explicit 2.5-stage bridge rather than a buried
  account helper, so an agent can inspect approval terms, submit the real portal
  form, confirm approval, reuse the account key, and make the first live call.
- **Reproducible search and competitor research.** Ten natural-language queries
  improved top-10 precision from 0.36 lexical to 0.78 with model-planned hybrid
  search, while opportunity-axis diversity rose from 1.2 to 3.7. A primary-source
  audit of public alternatives records the defensible positioning: search/detail/
  call MCPs exist, but the surveyed implementations leave utilization application
  and approval to the user.
- **Sliding session refresh.** Authenticated HTTP reads use a cookie jar across
  redirects and persist a rotated data.go.kr session only after the requested
  account page is verified as authenticated. Active use can therefore extend a
  portal session without leaving Chrome open; absolute SSO expiry still requires
  `gongctl login`.

### Changed

- **The 2026-08 data.go.kr redesign is supported end to end.** KRDS search results,
  account application lists, multi-operation detail pages, approval rows, and the
  application success response have fixture-backed parsers. Four new APIs were
  submitted, automatically approved, and called on a real account: Onbid bid
  results, Nara procurement notices, wholesale-market auctions, and SME support
  announcements.
- The README now leads with the four user bottlenecks gongctl removes: exact keyword
  guessing, manual specification triage, portal application/approval work, and
  hand-written authenticated calls. Integration instructions cover Codex, Claude,
  Gemini, Cursor, and optional Ollama without implying that consumer subscriptions
  are generic model API credentials.

### Fixed

- data.go.kr's broken TLS 1.3 path no longer prevents portal access. The verified
  TLS 1.2 workaround is scoped to data.go.kr transports and the dedicated browser;
  unrelated API endpoints retain normal TLS negotiation.
- `doctor` no longer reports a portal markup drift when an expired session sends
  the key URL to the generic public homepage. Both application and key checks now
  classify that state consistently as `gongctl login` required.
- Exact lexical matches are protected from semantic reranking, mandatory request
  variables are preserved across redesigned detail layouts, and application success
  is confirmed from both the JavaScript dialog and the account list fallback.
- Account-wide credentials now stay behind a stricter boundary: MCP no longer
  returns the service key, calls upgrade and restrict key injection to the official
  `https://apis.data.go.kr` gateway, response bodies and catalogue result counts are
  bounded, and untrusted dataset identifiers are validated before portal navigation.
- Agent auto-selection falls through installed but unavailable CLIs within one
  three-minute budget, sends goals over stdin rather than process arguments, and
  requires the real portal purpose category for every application.
- Headless application browsers use isolated ports/profiles, are reaped on every
  exit path and on signals, and leave a recoverable marker so `logout` can clean up
  a browser left by an ungraceful process exit. Application pagination now works in
  both cookie-HTTP and live-browser modes without returning duplicate pages.
- Session operations use a cross-process advisory lock, so separate Codex, Claude,
  Gemini, Cursor, CLI, and MCP processes cannot race while the portal rotates the
  shared cookie. Local Chrome debugger probes are time-bounded as well.
- Catalogue and semantic snapshots are fsynced and atomically replaced; release
  tags independently run module, vet, test, and build gates before publishing.

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- **`describe` hands over the publisher's address for LINK datasets** (`linkUrl`).
  It previously said the spec lives on the publisher's site and the portal cannot
  help, while the portal was displaying that very URL a row away — every LINK dataset
  sampled (70/70) carries it. An agent that cannot get there guesses parameters
  instead, so the address is now surfaced and named in the note.

  gongctl does not follow it, and the note says why: the publishers are a long tail —
  39 distinct hosts across 70 sampled datasets, the largest 13% — each with its own
  registration, key and spec format. There is no single portal to support that would
  unlock the LINK 40%. The note also states that gongctl's account key does not work
  there, because "the spec is at this URL" otherwise reads as "and your key will
  authorise it".

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- **`call --wait` (MCP `waitSeconds`) waits out the gateway propagation.** An
  application is granted the instant it is made and the API still answers 403 for
  minutes — 7 to 10 in every run measured here. Previously the only handling was an
  error message asking the caller to retry, which put a timed retry loop in every
  agent and script that uses this, over behaviour belonging to the portal. Now the
  request is repeated once a minute until it answers or the wait runs out.

  The 403 became its own sentinel, separate from a rejected key, because the two
  demand opposite responses: propagation is fixed by repeating the identical request,
  a rejected key never is. Only propagation is retried — a bad key or malformed
  request still returns on the first attempt rather than being buried under a
  ten-minute wait. Running out of time is reported as "not propagated yet", with the
  elapsed time and attempt count, so a caller knows to ask again rather than re-apply.
  Capped at an hour (the portal's own ceiling); MCP caps at five minutes, since a
  tool call that blocks for an hour reads as a hung agent.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- **`describe` surfaces the portal's 심의유형** as `approval{dev, ops, raw}` — whether
  an application is granted automatically or waits for a person at the publishing
  agency. `dev` is the stage gongctl's applications go through and decides whether a
  key arrives immediately; `ops` says what a later move to production would face. A
  missing row reports nothing rather than "automatic", and wording the parser does
  not recognise is kept verbatim instead of being read as auto-approved — assuming
  automatic is the answer that leaves a caller waiting on approval that is not coming.

### Changed

- **A known limitation from 0.1.0 was overstated and is withdrawn.** It said only
  auto-approved applications work and 심의 datasets cannot be driven to approval,
  which reads as a class of datasets gongctl cannot handle. In a random sample of 90
  catalogue entries, none required review at 개발단계 — the stage gongctl applies
  through. 57 carried the row (all 자동승인 at 개발단계, 16 of those 심의승인 at
  운영단계) and 33 had no row, being LINK datasets with no application path here
  anyway. The review gate is real but sits at 운영단계, which gongctl does not do; as
  written, the limitation would have talked users out of datasets that apply fine.

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- **`call --pk` looks the endpoint up instead of you typing one** (MCP `call_api`
  takes `pk`/`op`). Endpoint paths are not guessable —
  `HeatWaveCasualtiesRegion/getHeatWaveCasualtiesRegionList` cannot be derived from
  "지역별 폭염 인명피해" — and a wrong one answers 500 or 404 rather than saying it does
  not exist, so it reads as a broken API instead of a typo.
- **Required request variables are checked before the request is spent.** Omitting
  one makes data.go.kr answer with an *empty result rather than an error*, which is
  indistinguishable from a dataset that genuinely has no matching rows. Required-ness
  is read by prefix, because the embedded Swagger document says 필수/옵션 while the
  rendered HTML table says the portal's own 필/옵 — a check written against one
  vocabulary silently passes everything described by the other. Parameters the portal
  never documented block nothing.

### Fixed

- **`describe` no longer double-counts operations.** Some pages render each 상세기능
  twice — a desktop table and a mobile one — so a one-operation dataset reported two
  identical operations, which surfaced as an ambiguous choice whose two alternatives
  were the same call. Byte-identical operations are collapsed; operations sharing an
  endpoint but documenting different variables are kept.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- **The catalogue now records each dataset's service type, and two in five are a
  dead end.** 4,770 of 11,932 OpenAPI datasets are `LINK`: the portal publishes no
  spec for them and only links to the publisher's site, so `describe` cannot
  produce an endpoint and an application spent on one buys a key that cannot be
  used here. Nothing surfaced that before — searching 폭염 returned a LINK dataset
  second, ahead of three callable ones, purely on application count.

  `catalog search --rest-only` (MCP `restOnly: true`) keeps only what the portal
  reports as REST; every result carries its `svcType` either way, and `catalog
  info` reports the breakdown. Verified against `describe` from the opposite
  direction: the LINK-labelled dataset reports `apiType: LINK` with zero
  operations, the REST-labelled one reports two operations with a live endpoint.

  Labels come from the portal's own `svcType` filter, and the counts it returns
  (REST 7,156 / LINK 4,770) account for the catalogue exactly. `sync` still starts
  with an unfiltered sweep that defines the catalogue, then labels what it found,
  so a service type nobody here has heard of yet leaves an entry **unlabelled
  rather than missing or mislabelled** — the 6 datasets the portal reports as
  neither show up as 미확인. Sync now takes ~235s instead of ~160s.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **API catalogue** (`catalog sync|search|orgs|info`, MCP `catalog_search`) — the
  portal only answers keyword queries, so finding out whether a dataset exists
  meant inventing search terms one at a time and never knowing whether a miss
  meant "doesn't exist" or "wrong word". `sync` sweeps the whole OpenAPI list
  (11,932 datasets in ~160s, 60 requests) into a local snapshot; `search` answers
  from disk instantly, ranked by application count, because demand is the best
  available proxy for "this one is actually usable".

  The gap this closes is real and was measured, not assumed: while researching
  heatwave data, four separate keyword searches missed
  기상청_생활기상지수 (5,045 applications, carries the heat-index figures) because
  none of the guessed words matched its wording. One catalogue search finds it.

  Descriptions are stored but never returned — they are what makes matching work
  and also what wrecks an agent's context (ten of them is ~3,000 characters of
  prose nobody asked for). Results are compact rows plus the total match count, so
  a caller can tell it should narrow the query rather than page blindly.
- **Queries can be written as sentences.** `"폭염에 취약한 고령자 데이터"` used to
  return nothing, because every term had to appear and particles and the word
  데이터 never do. Terms are now reduced (trailing particles trimmed, fillers
  dropped) before matching. Entries matching *every* term still win; only when
  there are none are the terms ORed — and that widening is reported as
  `relaxed`/`matched` rather than hidden, because a widened search answers a
  different question than the one asked. A term in the dataset's name outranks the
  same term buried in its blurb.
- **`catalog sync --if-stale`** — syncs only when the snapshot is old, so a cron
  entry or CI step can refresh unconditionally without anyone having to remember
  the cadence.
- **`doctor` now checks catalogue freshness**, reporting a stale snapshot as
  drift. A stale catalogue keeps answering while silently omitting everything
  published since the sync, which is exactly the kind of quiet wrongness `doctor`
  exists to make loud.

### Fixed

- **`apply` no longer burns the login session.** The portal rotates its session
  cookie during the application flow, and the rotated cookie lived only inside the
  headless browser — so every `apply` left the saved session dead and the next
  command demanded a fresh login. The rotated session is now captured before the
  browser closes (and only if it actually works, so a failed apply cannot
  overwrite a good session with a broken one).
- **`login` no longer opens a second login screen.** Polling for completion
  navigated a fresh tab to an authenticated page each time, which the portal
  bounced back to its login wall — so the user watched a second login appear on
  top of the one they were using. Login is now detected by reading cookies without
  navigating at all.
- **A rejected serviceKey is retried once with a freshly read key.** The cached
  key is normally right, but goes stale when the key is reissued on the portal;
  previously that surfaced as an authentication failure the user had to diagnose.
- Gateway propagation guidance now states the measured wait (7~10 minutes; the
  portal's own ceiling is an hour) and says explicitly that `list_applications`
  showing 승인 does not yet mean callable.
- `catalog sync` progress reported every 1,000 datasets, which left the first
  stretch of a multi-minute command silent and indistinguishable from a hang; it
  now reports every page.

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- **`logout` now removes the Chrome profiles**, not only the stored cookies and
  cached serviceKey. The login profile accumulates the cookies of whatever the
  human logged in *with* — an SSO provider's session, some of them persistent —
  and the headless profile holds the session gongctl injected. Leaving those
  behind after an explicit logout was the wrong boundary. Verified: 4.2 GB → 0 B,
  no cookie database left under the config directory.
- README's security section now states what is actually written to disk (with
  permissions), what `logout` removes, and the risks that remain: the files are
  `0600` but not encrypted; the local CDP port is reachable by other processes on
  the same machine while `login`/`apply` runs; MCP `apply` creates real
  applications without a human confirmation, so prompt injection through portal
  text can produce unwanted ones (the CLI's y/N confirm is the safer path); and
  the serviceKey is account-wide.

## [0.1.0]

First release. A Go CLI + MCP server that automates data.go.kr (공공데이터포털)
so an AI agent can go from "I need this data" to actual API responses without a
human touching the portal.

**A person logs in once in a browser. Everything after that — searching,
applying, confirming approval, fetching the issued key, calling the API — the
agent does itself.** No key is ever copied and pasted; after login no browser
window stays on screen.

Verified end to end on a real data.go.kr account: search → apply (auto-approved)
→ approval confirmed → serviceKey fetched → API called, with zero visible
browsers throughout.

### Added

- **Dataset search** (`search`, MCP `search_datasets`) — keyword search over
  data.go.kr's file and OpenAPI datasets. Results carry each dataset's publisher,
  last-modified date, view count and application count, so a dataset can be
  judged without opening its page. `--per-page` sweeps large result sets in few
  requests (the full OpenAPI catalogue — 11,932 datasets — in 60).
- **활용신청 automation** (`apply`, MCP `apply`) — fills and submits the
  application form by driving the portal's own `fn_save()`, so the portal builds
  and validates the payload. Auto-approved dev accounts get a key immediately.
- **Application list** (`applications`, MCP `list_applications`) — status, account
  type, and expiry. Paginated, so accounts with more than ten applications are
  reported in full.
- **serviceKey retrieval** (`key`, MCP `get_api_key`) — reads the account key the
  portal issues on first approval. `call` uses it automatically when `--key` is
  omitted, which is what closes the loop for an agent.
- **OpenAPI describe** (`describe`, MCP `describe_api`) — surfaces operations,
  endpoints and request variables. Reads the Swagger 2.0 document the portal
  embeds in the page when present (the authoritative source) and falls back to
  the rendered tables. Reports the portal's `API 유형`: REST pages carry a spec,
  LINK pages only point at the publisher's site. Surface-only — it never invents
  a parameter, and says where the spec actually lives when the page has none.
- **Authenticated call** (`call`, MCP `call_api`) — injects the serviceKey,
  converts XML responses to JSON, and surfaces error codes rather than swallowing
  them. A 403 right after approval is explained as gateway propagation (minutes,
  not a key problem) instead of being left to guesswork.
- **`doctor`** — drives each scraping seam live and reports ok/drift/skipped,
  exiting non-zero on drift. This project scrapes fragile HTML by necessity, so
  drift is made loud rather than absorbed.
- **MCP server** (`mcp`) — six tools plus a `gongctl://guide` resource, over
  stdio.
- Output as `json` / `jsonl` / `table`; goreleaser + Homebrew tap +
  `install.sh` / `install.ps1` distribution.

### Security

- The login browser is closed once its session cookies have been copied out, so
  no window and no browser process is left running. Reads then go over plain
  HTTP; only 활용신청 submission needs a browser, and that one runs **headless**
  with the session injected.
- Chrome is launched **without** `--remote-allow-origins=*`, so a malicious local
  web page cannot open the CDP port and drive the authenticated session (Chrome
  rejects foreign-Origin WebSocket upgrades; verified by spike). chromedp still
  attaches, as it sends no Origin header.
- The serviceKey is never logged or persisted in the clear: it is redacted from
  transport-error messages, and the cached copy is written `0600`. `logout`
  clears both the cookies and the cached key.

### Known limitations

- Only auto-approved applications work; 심의(manual-review) datasets are listed
  with their status but not driven to approval.
- A freshly approved API answers 403 at the gateway for minutes (about 8 in
  testing, up to an hour by the portal's own guidance) before it can be called.
- LINK-type datasets have no spec on the portal, so `describe` can only say so
  and point at the publisher.
- The portal's HTML can change at any time; `doctor` exists to detect that.
