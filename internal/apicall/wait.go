// propagationPoll is how often CallWaiting retries. Observed propagation runs 7–10
// minutes, so a shorter interval only adds requests the gateway will refuse; a
// longer one wastes minutes after it becomes ready. A variable so tests can run the
// retry logic without sleeping through it.
var propagationPoll = 60 * time.Second

// MaxPropagationWait bounds any caller's wait. The portal's own guidance says
// approval can take up to an hour, and waiting longer than that is no longer
// waiting for propagation — it is waiting for something that is not going to happen.
const MaxPropagationWait = time.Hour

// CallWaiting is Call, except that a gateway 403 — the approval has not reached
// apis.data.go.kr yet — is treated as "not yet" rather than a failure, and the
// request is repeated until it succeeds or wait runs out.
//
// This exists because the wait is unavoidable and the 403 is indistinguishable, to
// anyone who has not read the portal's behaviour, from a bad key: the application
// shows 승인 the moment it is made, and the API still refuses for minutes. Every
// other error returns immediately — a rejected key or a malformed request will not
// improve by being asked again, and retrying it would only obscure the real reason.
//
// notify, when non-nil, is called before each sleep with the elapsed time, so a
// caller can show progress rather than appearing to hang for ten minutes.
